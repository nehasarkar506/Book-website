                                                    In a faraway land, there was a huge garden. It was full of lush green grass,
                                                     tall trees, and pretty flowers and fruits. The grass was as cosy as a bed.

                                                            In a faraway land, there was a huge garden. It was full of lush green grass, tall trees, and pretty flowers and fruits. The grass was as cosy as a bed.

After school, children used to come to play in the garden, and they enjoyed themselves a lot with the birds chirping all around.

“I love this garden, as it has so many trees, flowers, and such a soft carpet of grass,” said one kid to his friends.

Other kids also seconded his thoughts and said in coherence, “We all love this garden for the same reason. It is so much fun to be here,”

The garden used to be filled with the sounds of children’s laughter, making it a happy and lively place.

However, the garden belonged to a giant who had gone to visit one of his friends for several years now.

Everything was going great. The trees were happy; the birds used to chirp until, one day, the Giant returned.

The loud thumps shook the ground, and everyone saw the Giant standing there.

The Giant was furious when he saw so many children in the garden.

“What are you all doing?” shouted the Giant. “How dare you all come here? This is my garden, and I don’t think I have ever permitted you to play here. Go away and never come back again.”

Hearing the Giant’s voice, the children started trembling in fear and ran away.

To stop the trespassing of the kids, the Giant put up a massive wall around the garden with the board “Trespassers will be prosecuted”.

Without the children, the garden became sad. The trees shed their leaves, and the birds left the garden. The flowers stopped blooming, and the lush green grass lost its colour.

Soon, spring came. It was filled with greenery everywhere except in the Giant’s garden, where it was still winter. It was filled with only two things: snow and hail.

They were having a gala time there.

“I will never leave this garden”, said the snow.

“Me too”, said the hail. “Let us invite the north wind here too.”

And with the north wind there, cold winds started blowing in the garden. It knocked off the chimney pot of the garden and started taking off the slates of the roof one by one. The garden was a mess.

The Giant used to sit wearing his winter clothes and wondered, “I wonder when Spring will come into this garden.”

One day, as the Giant was lying on his bed, he suddenly heard a bird chirping near his window. He rushed to the window to see what the matter was.

He was astounded to see the view. The garden was green again, and the trees were full of leaves, and flowers were blooming all around.

He suddenly saw some children playing in the garden. They had found a hole in the wall and entered from there.

The Giant became so happy that he rushed toward the children and started playing with them. He knocked off the wall and removed the board.

“You all are welcome into my garden, and I will not scare you away,” said the Giant.

The Story Of The Selfish Giant With Moral For Children

After that, he always used to play with the children. One day, he saw a little boy trying to climb a tree where spring had not yet reached. He immediately helped the little boy get to the top, and as soon as he did that, the snow melted, and the tree became green again.

Years passed by, and the Giant became old and feeble. He could no longer play with the children, but he always used to sit and watch them play. He loved seeing them play.

One day, the old Giant was sitting on his chair when he heard someone crying. He rushed towards the sound and found the same little boy he had once helped. His arms were filled with blood.

“Oh no!” said the Giant. “Who has hurt you, little kid? Tell me his name, and I’ll not leave him.”

“Don’t worry, lovely Giant. These are wounds of love”, the little boy said.

The Giant could not understand anything.

The little boy continued, “Remember, one day you helped me climb the tree. Now, it’s my turn to take you to a beautiful place called the Garden of Paradise. Please come with me.”

The Giant followed the little boy.

Later that day, everyone saw the Giant dead, and his body was lying near a tree covered with
 beautiful cherry blossoms with a peaceful and contended smile on his face.
